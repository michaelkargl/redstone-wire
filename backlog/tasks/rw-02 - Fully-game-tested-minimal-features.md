## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
All the minimal features of the redstone wire need to be game tested

- Powering by redstone d irectly on ground level
- Powered by input block when wires are higher up
- Is input signal strength equal to output signal strength
- Is input signal transmitted immediately or delayed

Basically what we want to test is

- Can we transfer a redstone signal in the most minimalistic way via a redstone wire in a timely fashion
