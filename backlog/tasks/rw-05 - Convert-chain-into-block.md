## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Somehow in the center of the block we are still using a chain hitbox.
Signs, cables or levers can only be placed on the block if aiming at the invisible chain block in the middle of the connector block.

This is unwanted, we want to refactor the block to be a real square block without inner life.
